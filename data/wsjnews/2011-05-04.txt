Conventional wisdom about the bad blood between werewolves and vampires is flipped on its head in this popular BBC series. Roommates George (werewolf), Mitchell (vampire), Annie (ghost), and later Nina (human, turned werewolf) attempt to coexist with humans but cannot evade the supernatural. This season, they must flee to South Wales while Annie is trapped in purgatory. Season 4 begins next year and the Syfy channel has announced that its U.S. remake will return for a second season.
This British drama was canceled after one season but seeks success in the U.S. with an ABC pilot in the works. It focuses on a police unit specializing in identity theft. The motley group is led by no-nonsense Detective Superintendent Martha Lawson (Keeley Hawes, star of the 2010 "Upstairs, Downstairs" revival). Her team includes former undercover cop DI John Bloom (Aiden Gillen, "The Wire"), whose expertise proves a double-edged sword.
A sort of Victorian CSI, this Canadian show is set in late 19th-century Toronto; Yannick Bisson stars as William Murdoch, a detective ahead of his time who uses unconventional investigation techniques such as fingerprinting. Historical figures Nikola Tesla and H.G. Wells are tied into this season's plots (H.G. Wells attempts to recruit Murdoch into a eugenics society). Season 4 begins airing May 10 in Canada.
