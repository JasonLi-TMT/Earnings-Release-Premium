  Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks End Modestly Lower

MARKETS AT A GLANCE
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT:
U.S. stocks ended modestly lower in a choppy session as investors continued to weather weak economic data. Treasurys and gold closed higher as concerns over the U.S. economy boosted the allure of safe havens, while the dollar weakened against major currencies. Oil slipped as analysts predicted a sixth straight weekly increase in U.S. crude supplies.
OPENING CALL:
Chinese investors will hope for an about-face from the Shanghai Composite, which fell 2.1% Tuesday and has slipped 5% in four sessions, after the People's Bank of China drained some liquidity through open-market operations.
Data to be reported Wednesday include Hong Kong's fourth-quarter GDP, Taiwan's January unemployment rate and Singapore's January industrial production figures.
EQUITIES:
U.S. stocks ended modestly lower as investors continued to weather weak economic data.
It was a lackluster day in the market with light volume as investors digested the recent rally and awaited additional statements from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Thursday.
Stocks have been rallying the past few weeks, in a quick reversal from the selloff seen over the few weeks before, buoyed by stabilization in emerging markets and the belief that recent disappointing U.S. economic data is a result of bad weather in parts of the country. The S&P 500 closed Monday just shy of a new high.
"The strength of this market in the face of continuing weak economic data amazes me," said Gary Flam, portfolio manager at Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages about $6.5 billion in assets.
Investors Tuesday largely shrugged off a disappointing reading of consumer sentiment. As with other recent disappointments, "investors are just chalking it up to bad weather," Mr. Flam said.
In corporate news, Dow component Home Depot rose after the home improvement retailer reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, and announced a 21% increase in its quarterly dividend.
Asian markets were mixed Tuesday. China's Shanghai Composite fell 2.1%, and has now fallen 5% in four sessions, after the People's Bank of China drained some liquidity through open-market operations. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average climbed 1.4%.
FOREX:
The U.S. dollar weakened against major currencies after discouraging consumer confidence data signaled an insecure American public hesitant to spend money.
Fewer Americans spending money points to decreased demand and an anxious view of the economy. The December and initial January consumer confidence numbers had been strong.
If the Federal Reserve perceives that the economy isn't improving enough, it could delay its measured reduction of bond purchases, which would weaken the dollar. Most investors still see that scenario as remote, however.
Earlier in the day, the euro had struggled against the dollar and the yen as investors sought safety in the American and Japanese currencies after further upheaval in Ukraine, a non-euro-zone country.
"Ukraine's proximity can drum up some fear in the euro," said Fabian Eliasson, head of U.S. currency sales at Mizuho.
BONDS:
Treasury bond prices rose as concerns over the world's two largest economies boosted the allure of the safe-haven market.
In late-afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year note was 14/32 higher in price, yielding 2.700%, according to Tradeweb. When bond prices rise, their yields fall.
Investors snapped up bonds as the Conference Board said its index of U.S. consumer confidence fell to 78.1 in February from 79.4 in January.
"As long as inflation remains in check and the softening of the economy continues, there is only a limited risk in holding high-quality fixed-income securities like Treasurys," said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income at Raymond James in Memphis, Tenn. "This parking of funds in Treasurys will likely be with us until the economy breaks out hard one way or the other."
COMMODITIES:
Oil prices slipped as analysts predicted a sixth straight weekly increase in U.S. crude stockpiles and as traders anticipated lower demand for heating-related fuel as the end of winter approaches.
The amount of crude oil stored in the U.S. likely rose by about 800,000 barrels last week, according to a survey of analysts by The Wall Street Journal, as refineries reduced demand to perform routine maintenance.
In addition, traders are lowering their expectations for heating-oil demand as they look toward spring. Weather doesn't often drive oil prices, but the extraordinarily cold U.S. winter has boosted demand for heating oil, which is made from crude, analysts say.
"The weather forecasts easing up a bit has put some downside pressure on prices," said Phil Flynn, an analyst with Price Futures Group in Chicago.
Gold prices rose to a 16-week high, as weak U.S. consumer confidence data raised doubts about the sustainability of the recovery.

  U.S. Stocks End Modestly Lower

    Investors Weigh Weaker-Than-Expected Data

NEW YORK—U.S. stocks ended modestly lower on Tuesday as investors continued to weather weak economic data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 27.48 points, or 0.17%, to 16179.66, after falling as many as 60 points earlier in the day and gaining as many as 47 points at its session high.
The S&P 500 index slipped 2.49 points, or 0.13%, to 1845.12, with financial and telecommunication shares leading seven of 10 sector groups lower. The benchmark index finished 0.2% below its Jan. 15 record.
The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 5.38 points, or 0.13%, to 4287.59.
It was a lackluster day in the market with light volume as investors digested the recent rally and awaited additional statements from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Thursday.
Stocks have been rallying the past few weeks, in a quick reversal from the selloff seen over the few weeks before, buoyed by stabilization in emerging markets and the belief that recent disappointing U.S. economic data is a result of bad weather in parts of the country. The S&P 500 closed Monday just shy of a new high.
"The strength of this market in the face of continuing weak economic data amazes me," said 



      Gary Flam, 



       portfolio manager at Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages about $6.5 billion in assets.
Investors Tuesday largely shrugged off a disappointing reading of consumer sentiment. As with other recent disappointments, "investors are just chalking it up to bad weather," Mr. Flam said.
The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer confidence fell to 78.1 in February from a revised 79.4 in January, first reported as 80.7.
Meanwhile, the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-City home-price index for December rose 13.4% on a year-over-year basis, compared with expectations of a 13.5% increase, with signs that monthly price gains could soon moderate.
Mike Levine, portfolio manager of the Oppenheimer Equity Income Fund, which has $5.7 billion in assets, said he continues to give economic data and corporate forecasts the benefit of the doubt after a difficult winter.
"Weather has been a big issue for many companies, but corporate earnings are moving in the right direction," Mr. Levine said. "As spring comes with better weather, we're looking for better data and forecasts from companies."
Overall, "stocks have a good setup," Mr. Levine said. With expectations for further gains, Mr. Levine's fund is heavily weighted toward the nation's biggest banks, including
Chase and Citigroup, he said. He also favors the auto sector and home builders.
Others said the light economic calendar Tuesday granted a chance to focus on news from individual companies.
"It is a stock picker's kind of day," said 



      Richard Sichel, 



       who oversees $2 billion as chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co, who said he was focused on news from
and J.P. Morgan.
Dow component Home Depot rose after the home improvement retailer reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, and announced a 21% increase in its quarterly dividend.
Fellow blue-chip J.P. Morgan fell after the bank said that 6,000 mortgage jobs may be cut this year as the largest U.S. lender adjusts to slowing demand for home loans and declining profitability in that business.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.701% from 2.750% late Monday.
Gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,343 an ounce, a four-month high, while crude-oil futures fell 1% to $101.83 a barrel. The dollar lost ground against the yen and the euro.
European markets recovered late in the session, with the Stoxx Europe 600 rising 0.1% and marking its highest close since Jan. 14, 2008. Germany's DAX 30 index fell 0.1% and France's CAC 40 gave up 0.1%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 slid 0.5%, after closing Monday at the highest level since Dec. 31, 1999.
Asian markets were mixed. China's Shanghai Composite fell 2.1%, and has now fallen 5% in four sessions, after the People's Bank of China drained some liquidity through open-market operations. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average climbed 1.4%.
In other corporate news,
tumbled after reporting a surprise fourth-quarter adjusted loss, and revenue that increased less than expected, as expenses related to its merger with OfficeMax increased and margins weakened.
Tesla shares surged after Morgan Stanley pinned a $320 target price on the shares, citing the chance of the electric-car maker becoming a major player in the electrical grid storage space as well as the auto industry. The company's Model S was also rated the best overall vehicle to buy by Consumer Reports.
Macy's gained after the department-store operator's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings topped estimates, but revenue fell a bit shy, as bad weather hurt sales in January. Still, the retailer's chief executive expressed optimism that customers would "return to a more normalized pattern of shopping" as weather improves.

  No Tesla Pothole in the Golden State

    To achieve both federal air-quality standards and climate goals, we need vehicles that achieve zero or near-zero tailpipe emissions.

Regarding Christopher Knittel's "
" (Cross Country, Feb. 15): To achieve both federal air-quality standards and climate goals in a time frame that is consistent with science, we need vehicles that achieve zero or near-zero tailpipe emissions with the potential for reducing total life-cycle emissions by 80% or more. Only plug-in electric and fuel-cell vehicles—targeted by California's zero-emission vehicle program—have these characteristics.
Many studies, including from the National Academies, show that these vehicle technologies have the potential to be cost-effective to consumers and provide large public and private benefits. Achieving this potential will require investment and public/private coordination.
Prof. Knittel implies that the ZEV program is picking winners. This is largely false. It is a performance standard, and while it is true that this applies only to the tailpipe, California has adopted a suite of other policies to reduce the emissions from electricity and hydrogen production, the fuels for these vehicles. Surprisingly, Prof. Knittel disparages market features of the program that provide flexibility to allow firms to trade among themselves and pursue strategies that are the most cost-effective.
While even 15% of vehicle sales in 2025 may be ambitious, the auto industry has repeatedly shown itself capable of impressive innovation when motivated and supported by sound policy and when it puts its best engineers to the challenge.










Having spent my fair share of time sitting in California traffic—and thereby achieving very low actual MPG figures—I think the Golden State would be better served in working on some societal means to truly achieve the exemplary numbers it continues to strive for by spending some time figuring out how to keep the cars moving.

  Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks Rise

MARKETS AT A GLANCE
(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)
SNAPSHOT
Investors blamed another round of disappointing U.S. economic data on the weather, sending stocks and the dollar higher, while Treasurys fell. Oil slipped as data showed weekly supplies rose, and gold fell on weak manufacturing data from China.
OPENING CALL
There's not much happening on the data front Friday in Asia, but the Bank of Japan is set to release the minutes of its January policy meeting. While the minutes themselves aren't likely to cause fireworks, they could provide some insight into the internal debate on the board about whether to engage in further easing.
EQUITIES
U.S. stocks gained broadly, propelling the S&P 500 closer to its record high, as investors shrugged off a mixed bag of economic reports.
U.S. stocks wavered early in the session, then turned higher midday, despite a raft of economic reports that provided a murky view of U.S. economic growth. Investors said they weren't too concerned about the reports, adding severe winter weather was likely obscuring recent readings.
"Everyone is trying to grapple with whether the slowdown that we've seen is the weather, or if there's something else going on," said Paul Karos, senior portfolio manager with Whitebox Advisors, which manages $3 billion. "There are some red flags. But these are things that we think are going to bounce back…we should start to see that in the March data."
While the firm is "more cautious" on U.S. stocks than it was last year, Mr. Karos said he has been buying stocks in some sectors that could briefly take a hit from icy weather, such as trucking companies, airlines, and auto parts.
Further muddying the picture was the leadership of sectors that are often seen as defensive plays. The telecommunications, health-care and utilities sectors were among the top gainers in the S&P 500. The telecom gains were led by Dow component Verizon Communications, which rose 3.4% after Jefferies analysts said "investors should take advantage of recent weakness" in the stock.
"We're not getting a clear message from this day of trading," said David Lefkowitz, equity strategist with UBS Wealth Management. "These are not the sectors you go to when you're feeling psyched about U.S. growth."
In corporate news, Facebook rose 2.3% to close the session at a new all-time high. The company said late Wednesday it agreed to buy messaging company WhatsApp for $19 billion in cash and stock.
Apple declined 1.2% after Barclays analysts downgraded the stock, saying they "believe it is time to step aside." They don't expect the company's new products to "move the needle" for sales, "given a maturing smartphone market," and said it could face margin pressures as well.
Shares of Tesla Motors surged 8.4% after the electric-car maker reported late Wednesday fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates and provided an upbeat 2014 outlook.
Dow component Wal-Mart Stores declined 1.8% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings at the low end of its previously lowered forecast range. The world's largest retailer also provided a current-quarter outlook below analyst estimates.
Safeway rose 2.1% after saying late Wednesday it was in discussions about a possible sale of the company. The grocer also said it would distribute the remaining 37.8 million shares its owns--a 72.2% stake--in Blackhawk Network Holdings to Safeway's shareholders.
In Asian trading Thursday, markets moved lower, with Japan and Hong Kong leading the region down, as an important measure of Chinese manufacturing activity dropped to a seven-month low.
FOREX
The dollar edged higher against most major currencies as investors considered to what extent a batch of mixed U.S. economic reports were influenced by the harsh winter weather.
Gauges for U.S. manufacturing, inflation and jobless claims exceeded or equaled economists' forecasts, giving the greenback a boost against the yen and euro in the morning. However, the Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing survey sank to negative 6.3 in February from 9.4 in January.
Analysts still question how accurate recent data are in measuring the state of the economy given the severe winter weather.
The market should have a better sense of the economy's health by the end of the first half of 2014, said Daniel Brehon, a strategist at Deutsche Bank.
"No one trusts U.S. data right now," Mr. Brehon said. "Clean data will tell us if this is a technical blip or a real slowdown in the economy, although we have no reason to believe it is a slowdown."
BONDS
Treasury prices fell for a second-straight session as investors brushed off another round of disappointing U.S. economic data and focused on the Federal Reserve's push to reduce monetary stimulus.
The two-day selloff comes as the Federal Reserve seems set on pushing ahead with its gradual stimulus reduction, undeterred so far by this year's string of downbeat data. The Fed currently buys $65 billion in bonds each month, down from the program's original $85 billion pace.
The pullback in bonds underscores the Fed's influence on the market. Despite a number of lackluster economic reports, traders say Treasury yields will be pointed higher, as long as the Fed continues to cut its bond purchases.
Markets "don't fully trust the data and weakness in things that are clearly weather inhibited reflect that distrust," said Ian Lyngen, government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group. The Treasury market suffered Thursday because "it simply didn't have new information."
COMMODITIES
Oil futures edged below four-month highs after government data showed reduced demand for crude oil as refiners undergo seasonal maintenance.
U.S. crude-oil supplies increased by 1 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 14, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said.
This was the fifth straight week of stockpile gains. Demand for crude oil typically falls in February and March as refiners close down units to undergo seasonal maintenance and prepare to blend summer-grade gasoline.
Refining capacity utilization fell 0.3 points to 86.8% of capacity. Analysts had expected the operating rate to drop by 0.5 percentage point in the week.
Gold prices fell after weak manufacturing sector data from China reignited worries the world's second-largest economy is heading for a slowdown.
TODAY'S HEADLINES
Hewlett-Packard Profit Rises
Hewlett-Packard said its profit jumped 16% as the computer maker trimmed expenses, and while sales again fell, the decline was less than Wall Street feared.
U.S. Jobless Claims Continue to Drop
Initial jobless claims benefits decreased by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 336,000 in week ended Feb. 15. That was slightly more than the 335,000 forecast by economists but continued the downward trend of the last few weeks.
U.S. Consumer Prices Up Slightly in January
Consumer prices advanced a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in January from the prior month, the Labor Department said. Core prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, were also up 0.1%. Economists forecast overall prices would climb 0.1% and core prices would rise by 0.2%.
Coca-Cola Finance Chief to Retire
Coca-Cola said that long-serving Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard will retire in May and be succeeded by Kathy Waller, another seasoned Coke executive.
Wal-Mart Offers Weak Forecast
Wal-Mart Stores offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for its recently started fiscal year and current quarter. Meanwhile, it confirmed its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings came in at low end of its initial forecast.

  U.S. Stocks End Mixed

*U.S. Stocks Close Mixed To Mostly Higher; DJIA Slips, While S&P 500, Nasdaq Rise
*S&P 500 Posts Seventh Gain In Eight Sessions; Closes 0.4% Below Jan. 15 Record High
*DJIA Slips 23.99 (0.15%) To 16130.40; Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble Lead Decliners, JPMorgan Chase Rises
*S&P 500 Advances 2.13 (0.12%) To 1840.76; Health Care, Energy Pace Sector Gainers
*Nasdaq Climbs 28.76 (0.68%) To 4272.78; Closes At Highest Level Since July 17, 2000
Stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors paused after the best week for stocks in two months and digested a new batch of soft economic numbers.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 23.99 points, or 0.15%, to 16130.40, as
weighed on the index after weak quarterly results. On Friday, the Dow rose 127 points, or 0.8%, to close at a three-week high, posting its biggest weekly gain of the year. The stock market was closed Monday in observance of Presidents Day.
The S&P 500 index added 2.13 points, or 0.12%, to 1840.76, with health-care and energy shares leading seven of 10 industry sectors higher. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 28.76 points, or 0.68%, to 4272.78.
"It was a quiet day for trading," said 



      Joe Saluzzi, 



       co-head of equity trading at institutional brokerage firm Themis Trading. After establishing a direction early in the day, there was little oscillation Tuesday. "It seems that we're back into that grinding, no-volatility trading environment," he said.
Stocks have risen in the last couple of weeks, despite a series of economic reports showing the U.S. economy started the year weaker than most had expected, as investors have become more comfortable attributing some of the softness in the data to bad weather.
On Tuesday, a disappointing reading on manufacturing data in the New York region was the latest sign of slowing growth. The New York Federal Reserve's Empire State index of manufacturing activity for February fell to 4.5 from 12.5 in January, below expectations of 8.0. The new-orders component fell into negative territory, which indicates contraction.
Meanwhile, a gauge of confidence among home builders also highlighted the effect of weather on sentiment. The National Association of Home Builders' housing market index for February plunged in February to 46, its lowest level in nine months, amid severe weather, worker shortages and limited availability of land. Economists had expected it to remain unchanged at 56.
"This is a market that is trying to figure out how much of the recent economic weakness is weather related or whether this is a real soft patch," said 



      Quincy Krosby, 



       a market strategist at Prudential Financial, which manages roughly $1 trillion in assets.
"The market is attempting to find equilibrium as we look ahead," she said. "It is going to take a while until we see data clean of bad weather," but strength in Treasury bonds Tuesday after the new batch of weak reports shows some investors aren't convinced the weather is to blame, she said.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.709% from 2.746% late Friday.
"As we come back up to the all-time highs, the question on everyone's mind is will we break through and what will it take to get us to new highs," said 



      Paul Zemsky, 



       chief investment officer of multiasset strategies at ING U.S. Investment Management, which oversees $200 billion.
But after the S&P 500 climbed 2.3% last week to close just 0.5% shy of its Jan. 15 record high, Mr. Zemsky expects a pause before stocks close that gap as investors await additional information on the state of the U.S. economy. As of Tuesday's finish, the benchmark index was 0.4% off its record.
"We need a little more clarity on the economy," he said. "Earnings have been better than anyone hoped and companies have shown they can grow earnings with only modest economic growth," he said. Now, investors are awaiting signs that that modest growth is still intact, Mr. Zemsky said.
Helping to boost stocks to start the holiday-shortened week was optimism in Japan after the country's central bank surprised the market Tuesday with an expansion of its lending programs in an attempt to increase the effectiveness of its easy-money policies. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average surged 3.1%.
Elsewhere in Asia, China's Shanghai Composite shed 0.8%.

WSJ Dollar Index73.630
SNAPSHOT:
Stocks, bonds and gold futures fell, while the dollar rose, as investors digested minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting and the latest signs of economic growth. U.S. oil futures hit another 2014 high, as a tightening picture for products refined from crude and improved domestic pipeline infrastructure buoyed the market.
OPENING CALL:
Taiwan will be releasing its January export figures Thursday. Given Taiwan's central role in electronics production, its exports and export orders are closely watched as harbingers of global demand. It is expected that exports will rise 7.4% on-year, but the Lunar New Year effect makes the January data less reliable than usual.
EQUITIES:
Stocks fell in a seesaw trading session as investors digested minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting and the latest signs of economic growth.
Stocks showed weakness for a second day in a row following two consecutive weeks of gains for the Dow industrials, which are down 3.2% in 2014.
The Dow had climbed as many as 95 points early in the session but turned negative around midday, after the International Monetary Fund warned about troubles in emerging markets.
Stocks plunged again after minutes from last month's Fed meeting indicated that a few central bank officials argued for raising interest rates sooner than expected.
In corporate news, Panera Bread rose after the casual-restaurant chain reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, but provided a first-quarter outlook that was below current projections.
Zale soared after the jewelry retailer agreed to be acquired by larger rival Signet Jewelers for about $690 million in cash. Signet's stock climbed.
Asian markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average pulled back 0.5% after shooting up 3.1% on Tuesday, while China's Shanghai Composite climbed 1.1% to a two-month high.
FOREX:
The U.S. dollar pushed higher against major currencies after Federal Reserve meeting minutes showed support for the current pace of cutbacks to its bond-buying program.
The dollar rose against the euro in the wake of January's minutes of the Federal Reserve's rate-setting-committee meeting, but by the end of the day, pared some of its gains.
Fed officials also started to debate when to begin raising interest rates, with a few arguing a rate increase may be appropriate "relatively soon." However, the consensus view at the Fed is that 2015 would be the best time to start increasing rates. Keeping rates low has weighed on the value of the dollar.
The greenback climbed 1.2% against the Canadian dollar to C$1.1082, its highest level in just more than a week, after Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. agreed to purchase Devon Energy Corp.'s Western Canadian natural gas and light oil assets for $C3.125 billion
BONDS:
Treasury bonds took a beating after minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting raised some anxiety that the central bank could increase short-term interest rates sooner than many expected.
The minutes delivered a surprise to bond investors: Fed officials in January started to debate when to start raising interest rates, with a few arguing they might need to move sooner than expected.
That was in contrast to recent comments from Fed officials, including Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, that the central bank would keep short-term interest rates lower for longer to support the economy even if it intends to phase out its bond purchases by the end of this year. Many investors and traders have expected the first rate increase by the Fed in the second half of 2015.
The Fed reduced its monthly bond buying by $10 billion to $65 billion at the Jan. 28-29 meeting, following the announcement of a $10 billion cut at its December meeting. The minutes released Wednesday afternoon showed broad support to continue to reduce bond buying this year.
Yields on shorter-dated Treasury bonds, which are most sensitive to changes in expectations about the Fed's interest rate policy, rose only modestly after the minutes. Some analysts took it as a sign that concerns remain contained on the possibility of the Fed raising interest rates.
COMMODITIES:
U.S. oil futures cruised to another 2014 high, as a tightening picture for products refined from crude and improved domestic pipeline infrastructure buoyed the market.
A frigid winter has driven strong demand for heating-related fuels such as natural gas and heating oil, and prices have surged as inventories have fallen. In government data released last week, inventories of distillates, which include heating oil, were 10% below year-ago levels and 22% below average for this time of year.
Though weather isn't normally a strong driver of crude prices, the tight supply picture has traders betting that crude will be in high demand for more refined products--particularly as new extended weather forecasts predict another severe cold spell for much of the U.S. in the next week to two weeks.
Gold and silver futures extended losses in aftermarket trading on Wednesday after meeting minutes showed Federal Reserve officials discussed the possibility of raising interest rates sooner than expected.
TODAY'S HEADLINES: [8-10 biggest stories of day from NA, GM]
Fed Minutes Show Some Support to Raise Rates
Federal Reserve officials in January started to debate when to start raising interest rates, with a few arguing they might need to move sooner than expected, according to minutes of the Fed's policy meeting.
Facebook to Buy WhatsApp for $19 Billion
Facebook Inc. said it will pay $19 billion in a cash-and-stock deal to acquire smartphone-messaging app WhatsApp Inc. Under the terms of the deal, disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Facebook would acquire all outstanding stock and options in WhatsApp for about 183.9 million Facebook shares, valued at about $12 billion.
Tesla Reports Narrower Loss; Stock Jumps
Tesla Motors said its 4Q loss shrank to $16.2 million, compared with $90 million loss a year earlier, and cautioned its expenses will increase "significantly" this year as it invests in future models and facilities. Shares jump 12% late.
U.S. Housing Starts Fall 16% in January
U.S. housing starts in January fell 16% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 880,000, the Commerce Department said. Economists expected housing starts would fall 4.9% to 950,000.
IMF Report Warns on Emerging-Markets Problems
The International Monetary Fund issued its most detailed warning about the financial problems arising in emerging markets this year, saying some countries need to tighten monetary policy and make structural economic changes.
FCC Plans to Issue New Net Neutrality Rules
The Federal Communications Commission said that it will craft new rules to prevent Internet service providers from charging companies like Netflix or Google a toll to reach consumers at the highest speeds.
Fed's Bullard Sees Steady Fed Taper
A strong U.S. economy facing its best prospects since the financial crisis will likely allow the Federal Reserve to steadily reduce its monthly bond purchases, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Lockhart Says Taper to Proceed Despite Weak Data
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said he's "looking through" recent weak economic data, and continues to expect the central bank to wind down its bond-buying stimulus program over the remainder of this year.
U.S. Producer Prices Up 0.2% With New Measure
The prices businesses receive for their goods and services rose in January, a possible sign of accelerating inflation in coming months. The new "core" measure, which removes prices of food, energy and trade services, moved up 0.1%.

  Pricey Hydrogen Cars to Challenge Electric

    Toyota, Others Chase Emissions Credits That Can Offset Gasoline-Powered Vehicles

Under pressure from regulators, several auto makers are preparing to roll out emissions-free cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells instead of gasoline engines.
Three car makers have disclosed plans to lease a small number of new vehicles in California and in a few countries in Europe by the end of next year. South Korea's

is expected to be first out of the gate this spring, followed next year by Japanese auto makers

and


California wants at least 15% of new vehicles sold in the state to produce zero emissions by 2025, and its regulations require auto makers to sell electric vehicles or fuel cell vehicles to meet the requirement. Its mandate means that fuel cell cars will get double the emission credits compared to electric vehicles.
The tests are an effort to determine how pricey hydrogen vehicles will compete with far less expensive gasoline- or diesel-powered cars. The biggest problem so far is their cost. Next is figuring out how to get the cars to fueling stations, where they are pumped with compressed hydrogen.
Leasing a midsize hydrogen-powered car can cost as much as a luxury sedan. Hyundai's Tucson hydrogen-fueled vehicle will be leased for $499 a month and only to people who live near fueling stations. The fuel is included in the lease. Honda has leased about 20 of its older model FCX Clarity sedans for about $600 a month since 2008.
The price and paucity of fueling sites have relegated hydrogen-powered cars to small demonstration fleets, mostly in California where taxpayers have been willing to subsidize refueling stations and offer other incentives. The state has a plan to build a network of 100 refueling stations across the state over the next decade.
Europe has been pushing hydrogen-powered cars, too. Last year, Germany implemented an ambitious plan to spread fueling stations throughout the country. European regulations are based on average CO2 emissions from vehicles, so a zero-emission car helps improve a company's average. Some Scandinavian countries also heavily tax new gasoline or diesel-fueled vehicles and give tax breaks to buyers of electric or hydrogen powered vehicles.
There are fewer than 15 public hydrogen fueling stations in the U.S. today.
"The thing about fuel cell vehicles is they have the potential to offer many of the things that consumers expect today from gasoline vehicles. For our long-term goals they could play a greater role," said 



      John Swanton, 



       an air-pollution specialist with the California Air Resources Board.
Fuel cells use a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to create electricity and water. In a car, the fuel cell would replace batteries as a source of power for electric motors, allow for faster refueling time than battery-powered electric cars such as

Model S. Hyundai says its hydrogen-powered Tucson sport-utility vehicle can refill in eight minutes. Tesla says a 240 volt link takes an hour for each 29 miles of driving.
The range is about the same. Hyundai says its Tucson can go up to 300 miles on a full tank while Tesla rates its fully charged 85 kwh vehicle at up to 300 miles at a constant 55 miles an hour.


Of course, interest in hydrogen fuel cells is mostly viewed as a way to displace fossil fuels in motor vehicles. On that score, interest has waxed and waned over the years in cycles that closely track the intensity of efforts by federal and state regulators to promote fossil fuel alternatives and the price of gasoline.


, for example, was an enthusiastic proponent of fuel cell technology before its 2009 bankruptcy. But after its government bailout and sweeping management changes, GM has played down fuel cell technology in favor of battery powered, plug-in hybrids such as its Chevrolet Volt.
GM says it has no current plans to commercialize a fuel cell vehicle until at least 2020 and is working with Honda on a joint project to share the costs.
Other industry executives that have invested in battery-powered or hybrid vehicles take a similar view. Tesla Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       has called fuel cells "bull----."
Chief Executive Officer 



      Dieter Zetsche



       recently said the technology was a decade from becoming commercially viable.
has no current plans to produce a fuel cell vehicle for sale.
The recent push by Hyundai, Toyota and Honda is driven by a need to gain zero-emission-vehicle credits in California and by what some auto makers see as the slow pace of improvement to the driving range and costs of lithium-ion batteries used in electric cars.
California's mandate requires auto makers to sell a number of zero-emission vehicles commensurate with their volume in the state. Because Toyota and Honda dominate the market in California, they are required to sell more zero-emission vehicles than others. Not complying could threaten their ability to sell vehicles in the state, which accounts for more than 10% of U.S. sales.
Among hydrogen-powered car supporters, Toyota Chairman 



      Takeshi Uchiyamada



       said he has doubts that battery-powered vehicles will be successful in the near term because of their limited range, high cost and long recharging times. The evidence: battery-powered vehicles make up only about one-half of one percent of the new vehicles now on the road in the U.S.
Another advantage of fuel cells is the technology can be scaled up to run large trucks—something that is more difficult with batteries.
"Fuel cells will be in our future sooner than many people believe…and in much greater numbers than anyone expected," 



      Bob Carter, 



       Toyota's senior vice president of automotive operations, said earlier this month.
Michael O'Brien, Hyundai product planning director, said the company "decided to put it out there and let the demand lead to [refueling] infrastructure." Its hydrogen Tucson SUVs match the range and refueling rate of gasoline-powered cars. "If you look at replacing gasoline without giving anything up, we are further ahead with fuel cells than we are with electric vehicles," he said.
Fuel cell skeptics say the U.S. government already has invested $5 billion in the infrastructure to build and support battery electric cars. Switching to hydrogen would require another big investment.
"In the current environment the prospects for fuel cells are very low. This is still an experiment. It's always 10 years out," said 



      Jeff Schuster, 



       a vehicle forecaster with LMC Automotive. The biggest enemy of the fuel cell is the advancement of traditional technologies like the internal combustion engine, he said. "We don't need it now; so it won't have a big impact."

  Tesla's Battery Ambitions Gets Stock Jumping

    Auto Maker's Hopes for Battery-Production With Panasonic Excites Investors

shares hit a record high of $248 on Tuesday ahead of an expected announcement of a battery-production partnership in which the company would carve out a business making advanced batteries for itself and others.


, now the primary battery supplier for Tesla's $71,000-and-up electric cars, is in talks about investing in a nearly $1 billion battery factory in the U.S., according to Japanese business newspaper the Nikkei. Panasonic said in a statement it was "considering various options to strengthen our ties" with Tesla.
Panasonic shares were up 7% in early trading in Tokyo on Wednesday.
Tesla this week is expected to announce with corporate partners a plan to build a factory that would produce finished batteries from raw materials instead of components, lowering its costs.
A Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment on plans for what it calls its battery "gigafactory" or on the potential for Panasonic as a potential investor.

auto analyst 



      Adam Jonas



       said in a note on Tuesday the company "could become the world's largest producer of Li-ion batteries" based solely on its own automotive needs. He said Tesla could also supply batteries for energy storage for electric power suppliers.
He put a target price of $320 a share on the Palo Alto, Calif., electric car maker, saying it has the potential to upend two existing industries—autos and electric power. Its shares were up 14% at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, giving the company a $30.5 billion market value.
Tesla Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       is chairman of

a solar energy provider that now offers Tesla battery packs to users of its solar arrays. The battery packs store energy for use during peak demands or nighttime use.
Tesla now operates from a 370-acre manufacturing site in Fremont, Calif., that is less than fully used.
Earlier this month, Mr. Musk told analysts during a conference call that he intends to work with several others, including "precursor" suppliers to complete its vision of a factory that takes in metal ores and produces finished batteries in the same way that 



      Henry Ford's



       River Rouge factory originally made its own steel for cars.
Mr. Musk has said the company would need its own supply of batteries to produce its third-generation electric vehicle, now expected in 2017. That vehicle would target the broader sedan market with a 200-mile range and a starting price of $35,000.
Tesla's goal is to reduce the cost of lithium-ion battery packs below $200 a kilowatt-hour, Morgan Stanley estimates. Argonne National Laboratories calculates other lithium-ion batteries cost about $500 a kilowatt-hour to manufacturing. Tesla maintains its costs are lower than others, but hasn't disclosed its production costs.
Mr. Musk hasn't said how the company would finance construction of a new factory. He did tell analysts that a secondary stock offering for a new plant and other uses was "a good idea. I think that would be the smart move."
Recently, officials in Reno, Nev., told a local newspaper that Tesla officials had scouted the area as a possible location for a battery plant. A person familiar with the situation said Tesla officials are considering the Reno area for its plant, but didn't have other details. Reno is home to a startup lithium mining-and-production operation owned by
The miner is developing a pilot plant to create lithium carbonate, a key ingredient in making lithium-ion batteries.
Jay Chmelauskas, 



       Western Lithium's chief executive, said his company's intention is to become a major supplier of lithium to U.S. battery manufacturers. When asked whether Western could be a provider to the "gigafactory," he said "we have the right address," without confirming discussions with Tesla, specifically.

  Lamborghini Chief Looks to Expand

    Sports-Car Maker's CEO Wants to Increase Production

SANT'AGATA BOLOGNESE, Italy—The head of

Lamborghini brand wants to increase production as he looks at ways to expand its two-model lineup, saying the luxury sports-car maker has room to grow without jeopardizing its image of exclusivity.
"Now that we have established the brand, we want to expand it," Automobili Lamborghini SpA Chief Executive 



      Stephan Winkelmann



       said in an interview ahead of the Geneva motor show next month. Lamborghini will show its new Huracán LP 610-4 at the show.
Lamborghini has confirmed plans to come out with a sport-utility vehicle in 2017. But Mr. Winkelmann declined to divulge what else was in store. He said Lamborghini had more experience than its rivals in making cars of various types, pointing to the Espada, a four-seater built in 1968, and the 350 GT front-engine model introduced in 1964.
"There is in the DNA of Lamborghini opportunities that go far beyond two models," he said.
Mr. Winkelmann said Lamborghini has received 700 preliminary orders for the Huracán, the successor to the Gallardo. That is equivalent to one-third of Lamborghini sales for all of last year. Like Lamborghini's other current model, the Aventador, the Huracán is a high-performance two-seat sports car.
The Huracán production line will have the capacity to build 13 cars a day, three more than the production pace for the Gallardo.
Introduced in 2003, the Gallardo, and later the Murciélago, Aventador's predecessor, helped set the tone for Lamborghini's image as the maker of brash roadsters. Vehicle sales soared in the ensuing years from a couple hundred a year to 2,121 in 2013.
The market for luxury sports cars—Lamborghinis start at €150,000 ($205,000) apiece—hasn't fully recovered from the slump suffered after the 2008 crisis. Sales in the segment shrank in 2013 to 13,180 vehicles, down 4% from the prior year, mainly because of weaker demand in Europe, according to IHS Automotive. Those sales are tiny compared with the estimated 71 million cars sold world-wide last year.
The niche is also becoming more crowded.
Brands in the segment include Aston Martin from Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd. and

Mercedes-Benz with models that cost more than €100,000.
U.K.-based McLaren Automotive, known for its Formula One race cars, entered the retail market in 2011 and will be presenting its fourth model at the Geneva auto show.


electric cars have also become an alternative to supercars with noisy, gas-guzzling engines.
Mr. Winkelmann said he is confident Lamborghini sales will grow more than the market thanks to demand from the U.S., Japan and the Middle East. He didn't disclose any targets.
Rival Ferrari, the leader in the supercar market segment, made a point of selling fewer than 7,000 cars last year and reported an operating profit of €364 million on revenue of €2.3 billion.
Ferrari is controlled by Italian auto maker
NV.
Some industry analysts see Lamborghini as a vanity project for its mass-market German parent, Volkswagen, much like sister brand Bugatti, which sells far fewer cars but for much more money—as much as €1 million each.
Mr. Winkelmann disagreed, saying Lamborghini had to have a business case to support the company's investment.
He declined to say how much money was spent on the Huracán, but he said it was "much more" than the €1 billion that car makers usually spend on models for the mass market.
Belonging to Volkswagen is a big help for Lamborghini because it can share development costs. Sister brand Audi codesigned Huracán's 5.2-liter, V-10 engine and supplied the aluminum part of its body.
In 2012, Lamborghini reported revenue of €469 million, but other numbers are hard to come by. Metzler Equities analyst 



      Jürgen Pieper



       estimates it contributes about 1% to Volkswagen's earnings.
In the third quarter of last year, Volkswagen posted a net profit of €1.86 billion on €47 billion of revenue. It is scheduled to report 2013 financial results in March.
Mindful of the regulatory pressure to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions from cars, Mr. Winkelmann said that he was prepared to consider other technologies as long as they didn't diminish Lamborghini's image.
Lamborghini has already incorporated different materials such as carbon fiber and aluminum to reduce body weight.
Mr. Winkelmann played down the impact of Tesla though, saying it serves a different clientele: one attracted to the environmental idea behind it.
"It isn't a sports car—it's the opposite," he said.

  Six Ways to Modernize Your Car

    Unlock your car with a smartphone, view your speed from your windshield and other new tricks to teach an old vehicle

far-out features to the latest cars at warp speed—everything from futuristic heads-up displays to simple perks like hands-free calling—the appeal of the newest showroom tech can be hard to resist. But a car, unlike a smartphone, doesn't need to be replaced every two years. In fact, older cars are maintaining pride of place in American garages. The median age of an automobile on the road is now over 11 years, the highest it's ever been, according to a study by the automotive research firm R.L. Polk. Thanks to improved reliability and corrosion resistance, hitting the 150,000-mile mark no longer merits a champagne toast.
Of course, older cars don't have all the latest digital bells and whistles, like rearview cameras or Pandora radio on the dash. But they easily can: Simple- or inexpensive-to-install upgrades can put a dated car in line, tech-wise, with a 2014 model—and, in a few cases, beyond. The latest gadgets, like Automatic and Viper SmartStart, can pinpoint the location of your vehicle in a parking lot, and tell you if your teenager has been speeding, even when you're 2,000 miles away.
These upgrades might not yet offer the most bleeding-edge features found on new cars (there isn't an add-on, yet, that will steer your car back into its lane should you meander out), but they can at least make your vehicle play nice with your smartphone.


A windscreen overlaid with data might seem like the fantastic future—unless you've visited a car dealership recently. So-called "heads-up displays"—which show your car's speed, and more recently, the next turn in your GPS driving directions—have appeared in an increasing number of mostly higher-end models from Audi, BMW and GM over the past few years. But improvements in legibility and light quality (and cheaper hardware) have more car makers putting them in new models—even in affordable cars like the 2014 Mazda3.
You can get a rudimentary but still pretty cool version of the tech with the
(
). This cassette-tape-size gadget sits on the dash and projects onto a film that you affix to the bottom part of the windscreen (or a small, clear lens attached to the front of the device). Garmin's display doesn't have its own GPS, but pulls data from a Garmin navigation app running on your smartphone to show your current speed, turn-by-turn directions and expected arrival time. If you're looking for a way to make your drive time feel like a 1980s videogame, this is it.


Taking a call over your smartphone's speakerphone while driving requires you to hold the device in one hand—illegal in more than 40 states—or shout into the cup holder where you've tossed the phone. Most new cars have integrated Bluetooth speakerphones, but turning an older car into a 65-mile-per-hour telephone booth is easy: Strap the
(
) to your visor. This rechargeable, garage-door-opener-size speakerphone connects to both smart and dumb phones over Bluetooth. Its two onboard mics, each with a digital noise canceller optimized for cars, ensure you won't sound like you're screaming in a wind tunnel when you place a call. For a monthly fee, you can even set the Supertooth HD to send texts or emails that you dictate while driving.


Plenty of factory-fresh cars boast "navitainment" systems with screens the size of Costco-special HDTVs. (Tesla, we're looking at you.) But bringing the touch-tastic experience to your older ride is as simple as swapping out its stereo with the
(
), available next month. It has a 7-inch touch screen—about the size of a small tablet computer—and can pipe tunes from your phone via Bluetooth as well as run apps for displaying traffic, gas prices or photos of your dog from your phone. If you don't need the fancy display, upgrade to an inexpensive Bluetooth-enabled receiver. Several brands, including Alpine and Kenwood, make models for under $150. The
(
), which comes out in March, is notable because it allows you to pair an NFC-enabled smartphone by touching the two devices together.


Over half of new cars sold today have rearview cameras, which can help you squeeze into tighter parking spots and, more importantly, might prevent you from accidentally hitting someone as you back out of your driveway. While the
(
), like most aftermarket cams, requires a dedicated screen on your dash, it also does double duty as a GPS. The system includes a wireless camera, powered by your car's rear-light circuit, that beams its image to the 7-inch display when you put your car in reverse. Setup is simple, but Garmin recommends a professional install.


New cars inform you in plain English when something isn't right, letting you know if a problem is as simple as a loose fuel cap, or more significant, like a misfiring cylinder. Older cars, though, use the much more obscure "Check Engine" light for problems both minor and catastrophic. Luckily there's a fix for most cars model-year 1996 and newer:
(
) plugs into what's known as an OBD-II port, usually located just below the steering wheel, to pull the same digital codes from your car that a mechanic would. Then its companion iOS app (an Android version is coming soon) will tell you what to do about them. The sensor also logs stats on your acceleration, deceleration and fuel economy to issue a driving report card of sorts that may inform you, among other things, that you've got a lead foot and should ease up a bit on the gas pedal.


Keyless entry systems allow you to lock and unlock your car remotely or warm it up from afar with your key fob, but the
(
) goes several miles beyond. The professionally installed system talks to a smartphone app (for Android, BlackBerry, iOS and Windows Phone) that allows you to lock, unlock or start the car from your smartphone, even using voice commands if you like. That means you could pop the trunk of your car in Los Angeles from across the country in Manhattan—or anywhere else you and your car have cellular access.

  Tesla Projects Big Increase in Production

    Luxury Electric-Car Maker Expects to Deliver 35,000 Vehicles in 2014

had a wildly successful run as a niche auto maker over the past year, capped by fourth quarter results that exceeded its projections. Now, Chief Executive 



      Elon Musk



       must navigate the even trickier road to becoming a high-volume, global player.
The Palo Alto, Calif., maker of $70,000 and up electric cars on Wednesday said it had a net loss of $16.2 million for the final quarter of 2013. Factoring out non-cash executive compensation and other costs, the company said it had a profit of $46 million, and generated $40 million in free cash flow, a sign that it is making money from building cars.
Revenue soared to $615.2 million from $306.3 million in the same quarter a year earlier.
The results—and Mr. Musk's bullish outlook for sales of the current Model S electric sedan and a future Model X electric sport-utility vehicle—boosted Tesla's shares by 12% to $216.67 in after-hours trading. That was on top of a run that has quadrupled the Silicon Valley company's share value in the past year, and made it more valuable than the much larger Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.
Tesla sold some 22,000 vehicles in 2013. This year, the company is forecasting sales of 35,000 Model S sedans. By the middle of this year, Mr. Musk said, the company expects to refit its factory to be able to build as many as 1,000 cars a week—implying annual production of close to 50,000 cars. Tesla said orders for its second vehicle are strong.
"The fish are jumping in the boat," Mr. Musk said. Tesla's stock of $5,000-a-car reservations grew to $163 million at year-end from $139 million a year earlier.
Within a decade, Tesla's goal is to produce half a million vehicles a year. That would push it past well-established auto makers like JaguarLand Rover and Porsche.
To get there, Tesla will have to bolster its parts suppliers, expand its factory in Fremont, Calif., and pour money into what Mr. Musk calls a "GigaFactory" to produce more battery packs. Mr. Musk said he would disclose his plan for building that battery plant next week. Tesla has an agreement with battery maker
to provide 2 billion cells to Tesla through 2017, but that won't be enough, Mr. Musk said.
Tesla will also have to contend with challenges from franchised dealers who are fighting its effort to expand its direct sales network beyond the coasts.


The short-term challenge for Tesla is ramping up its production to meet demand and finishing its coming Model X. Mr. Musk said that many of its suppliers simply didn't expect the company to sell as many vehicles as it has, and weren't prepared to meet demand.
Suppliers' output may be the biggest hurdle, said 



      Tom Lasorda, 



       the former president of Chrysler LLC, who also ran the now closed Fisker Automotive Inc. for about six months. "Getting their production up to 60,000 from where they are is relatively simple," he said. "The biggest challenge is can their supply base grow with them."
Tesla likely will have to invest in a big expansion of its production operations to build its "Gen-3" vehicle, a promised $35,000 sedan that can go 200 miles on a charge. That model is expected to launch in 2017.

analyst 



      Dan Galves



       said Tesla should be able to pay for the expansion of the plant and development of its next model from its cash reserves. Still, raising more capital shouldn't be a problem if it is needed, he said.
Mr. Musk told analysts the company may need to raise money to build a battery factory, though he didn't commit to it.
"The car business is truly, staggeringly big," Mr. Musk told analysts during a conference call. "There is just a pretty big ramp up in terms of investment."
Among the uncertainties Mr. Musk must manage is the long term demand for the Model S.
"It's difficult to predict where the demand settles out with the S," he said. He said he expects Model S demand can be sustained at production levels of about 1,000 cars a week and that Model X demand could exceed that figure.
Tom Libby, 



       a sales forecasting analyst with
Automotive, said the question is whether demand will continue to be strong as Tesla adds new models, or if the same pool of customers will be spread over more vehicles.
"It is extremely hard to forecast their volumes," he said. "They have been an aberration in that they have done well compared to other EVs."
Tesla is using its Supercharger network—high-voltage charging locations—to lower the inhibitions of people who want to trade their gasoline-fueled vehicles for an electric car. The electricity is free to Tesla owners and Tesla is spreading the locations around the U.S. It announced Wednesday the addition of free high-speed data connections and Internet radio to customers for four years.
So far, Tesla has avoided selling its cars through independent dealers. Tesla also doesn't use traditional advertising to sell its vehicles. But both could change someday.
"We aren't spending millions and millions of dollars on media production and media buy because we haven't had to," said 



      Diarmuid O'Connell, 



       Tesla's vice president of business development. "Will it be enough in the future? Who knows?"


Tesla's fourth quarter revenue was $615.2 million and it forecast first-quarter deliveries of 6,400 vehicles. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said revenue was $611 million and it would deliver 7,400 cars.

  California's Auto-Emissions Policy Hits a Tesla Pothole

    Credits for electric vehicles have the ultimate effect of reducing overall fuel economy.

It is a basic tenet of economics that regulations almost always have unintended consequences. While 



      Adam Smith



       may have been one of the first to understand this, he could not have possibly foreseen the morass of expensive and unwanted consequences that could come from conflicting emission and fuel standards enacted by the state of California and federal programs, such as for greenhouse gases and Corporate Average Fuel Economy.
Both the state and federal regulations have worthy goals: to decrease greenhouse-gas emissions and lower petroleum consumption. Yet taken together, the federal standards effectively cancel out the California standard. Instead of promoting fuel reduction as intended, the California standard allows for the production of less-efficient vehicles, while facilitating a massive transfer of cash via credit trading. It also forms a de facto industrial policy that sends us down a path toward electric vehicles that may or may not be the best technological or environmental choice for the future.
These are complicated regulations, so let me explain:
The State of California Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) standard requires a certain percentage of an auto maker's California sales to be zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles. For 2014 this requirement is about 1% of sales; the percentage is expected to ramp up to 16% in 2015. In principle, these sales can be either electric vehicles or some other technology such as hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, but currently electric vehicles are the only real option.
If a manufacturer doesn't meet this standard, it must buy zero-emission-vehicle credits from a manufacturer that has a surplus of credits. Tesla, for example, makes only electric vehicles and therefore has a surplus of credits.
was a major buyer of credits in 2013, purchasing over 300 zero-emission credits and over 500 "partial" credits. These numbers will continue to increase as the zero-emission mandate becomes more stringent.
The zero-emission mandate thus creates large transfers of wealth across automobile manufacturers. The beneficiaries of these transfers are companies selling more than their "fair share" of electric cars. For example, each Model S that Tesla sells generates seven zero-emission-vehicle credits that Tesla can sell to auto makers that are not selling their fair share. Recently, these credits sold for $5,000 each, bringing Tesla $35,000 in extra revenue for each Model S sold.
(the Leaf) and
(plug-in Prius) have also generated credits. On the other side of the ledger, companies selling few electric vehicles must raise the prices of their vehicles to pay for the zero-emission mandate.
The California policy is then superimposed on the federal standards, which require that the average fuel economy across a manufacturer's entire fleet of U.S. vehicles exceeds federally mandated standards for greenhouse-gas emissions and fuel economy. For example, the 2016 target requires that the average fuel-economy rating per vehicle across all manufacturers be 35.5 miles per gallon.
There are, however, a number of features that complicate this rule. For example, federal standards give special double credits for each electric vehicle a manufacturer produces. Given this feature, the end result of adding California's zero-emission-vehicle program to the federal standards is to
overall fuel economy—precisely the opposite of what was intended.
Here's how this works: Ignoring all other special credits under the federal program, if no electric vehicles were sold, average fuel economy in 2016 would be exactly equal to 35.5 mpg. However, each time an electric car is sold, the average fuel economy of all regular vehicles sold is allowed to decrease by
than the reduction that could be credited to an extra electric vehicle on the road. Why? Because electric cars garner double credits. Admittedly, the reduction in fuel economy is likely to be small, but what is important is that fuel economy moves in the wrong direction.
To be sure, supporters of the zero-emission-vehicle mandate may contend that there is another, more advantageous unintended consequence. They argue that these rules are promoting innovation in new technologies and new types of cars. Yet even if that were true, I would argue that there are better ways to promote innovation in the auto industry. The current process is flawed because it forces investment in a technology that may not end up being the ultimate winner.
Focusing on zero tailpipe-emitting vehicles overlooks an excellent alternative because policy makers are suffering from something that many in the industry believe consumers suffer from: Miles Per Gallon Illusion. MPG Illusion is when consumers do not realize that increasing fuel economy from 15 mpg to 20 mpg saves much more gasoline than going from 45 mpg to 50 mpg, because the former increase represents much a larger percentage. In other words, for someone driving 15,000 miles a year, the 45-to-50 mpg jump saves only 33 gallons a year, while the 15-to-20 rise saves 250 gallons. While the zero-emissions mandate may shift some Prius buyers to an electric car, the best option for reducing petroleum consumption and greenhouse-gas emission is shifting a large SUV buyer into a less-large SUV.
The government needs to be in the business of setting overall environmental goals and standards on both the state and federal levels that make sense both separately and together, not a confusing, conflicting set of rules. And it needs to get out of the business of picking market winners and losers.

  Hon Hai to List Cable Unit in Taiwan

    IPO, Planned for Next Year, Would Come Amid Push for Growth Abroad

TAIPEI—


, the top global contract manufacturer by revenue, intends to list its cable and connector unit in Taiwan next year as it seeks funds for overseas expansion and new technologies.
The unit's chief executive, 



      Sidney Lu, 



       said in a recent interview that the cable and connector unit plans to invest in manufacturing facilities in Harrisburg, Pa., amid efforts to expand into the automotive industry in the U.S.
Mr. Lu declined to disclose how much the Taiwan-based company, also known as Foxconn, plans to raise in the initial public offering of stock. Hon Hai assembles iPhones and iPads for


and has other clients including


and



"Some car makers in the U.S. are looking for domestic suppliers. This is a good push for us," Mr. Lu, 55 years old, said at Hon Hai's headquarters in Taipei.
He said the new manufacturing site in Pennsylvania would target the North American market and employ several hundred people. Cable and connector manufacturing is largely automated.
The unit, called Foxconn Interconnect Technology, already has set up a small research-and-development team in Pennsylvania. It also has manufacturing sites in China, as well as in Texas and California.
Cables and connectors are key components found in consumer electronics such as personal computers, smartphones, tablet computers and game consoles. Hon Hai Chairman 



      Terry Gou



       founded the company in 1974, when it began making plastic channel-changing knobs for black-and-white television sets. The company expanded into the PC industry in the early 1980s with the production of connectors, the relatively simple but ubiquitous parts that join components in a computer.


Strong demand for consumer products, including smartphones and tablets, have been driving FIT's growth during the past few years but prices are coming down as the market has become saturated, Mr. Lu said.
HSBC analyst 



      Jenny Lai



       said she estimates the cable and connector unit currently contributes only 2% of Hon Hai's total revenue but it could account for 15% to 20% of the group's earnings, as cables and connectors carry substantially higher profit margins. Last year, Hon Hai posted revenue of 3.95 trillion New Taiwan dollars (US$131 billion).
She also said FIT is expected to post double-digit revenue growth this year by expanding into new markets such as automotive, cloud services and networking.
FIT is the world's fourth-largest cable and connector maker by revenue, after Switzerland-based


and U.S.-based


and Molex Inc. Mr. Gou has said he aims to make FIT, with annual revenue of about $3 billion, No. 1 in a few years.
Hon Hai has been diversifying its business line and customer base as revenue from PCs and phone manufacturing slows. Earlier this month, the company said its January revenue edged up 0.3% from a year earlier to NT$314.55 billion.
Hon Hai has been expanding into automotive components and is planning "big projects" with


and

Audi luxury unit, Mr. Gou said last month. Hon Hai's


unit makes displays for U.S. electric-car maker Tesla Motor Inc.

  Tesla Model S Selected Consumer Reports' Best Overall Vehicle

    Japanese Brands, Which Have Historically Dominated the List, Took Only Five Spots

Consumer Reports rated Tesla Motor Co.'s Model S as the best overall vehicle to buy in
, which also included a Chrysler Group LLC product for the first time in 16 years.
The magazine bestowed the top honor on the electric-powered luxury vehicle based on its "blistering acceleration" and "razor-sharp handling" although the car retails for more than $89,000 and Tesla sold fewer than 23,000 of the vehicles last year.
The results come the same day Tesla's shares jumped 16% after Wall Street analyst Adam Jonas said the company warrants a share price of $320. Tesla is expected this week to announce plans to build a new battery factory along with partners that will be able to take raw materials in on one side and produce batteries out the other side, lowering the cost of battery cells. Mr. Jonas thinks that the cell production has the potential to have Tesla become a major competitor in the electrical grid storage business.
Chrysler's Ram 1500, meanwhile, landed the best pickup truck spot, with the magazine saying the vehicle was "surprisingly refined and inviting." The last Chrysler vehicle to win a top pick spot was the 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
"The competition in the marketplace has grown fierce," Consumer Reports automotive editor Rik Paul said in a statement. "There was a time when a handful of brands dominated our Top Picks list, but in recent years we have seen a more diverse group make the cut."
Japanese brands, which have historically taken more than 70% of the top spots since 1997, took only five spots, one of their worst showings in the 18-year history of the ranking.

  Stocks End Higher Despite Mixed Data

    S&P 500 Inches Toward Record High

NEW YORK—U.S. stocks gained broadly, propelling the S&P 500 closer to its record high, as investors shrugged off a mixed bag of economic reports.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 92.67 points, or 0.6%, to 16133.23. The S&P 500 index rose 11.03 points, or 0.6%, to 1839.78, closing just 0.5% below its record high. The Nasdaq Composite Index tacked on 29.59 points, or 0.7%, to 4267.55.
U.S. stocks wavered early in the session, then turned higher midday, despite a raft of economic reports that provided a murky view of U.S. economic growth. Investors said they weren't too concerned about the reports, adding severe winter weather was likely obscuring recent readings.
"Everyone is trying to grapple with whether the slowdown that we've seen is the weather, or if there's something else going on," said 



      Paul Karos, 



       senior portfolio manager with Whitebox Advisors, which manages $3 billion. "There are some red flags. But these are things that we think are going to bounce back… we should start to see that in the March data."
While the firm is "more cautious" on U.S. stocks than it was last year, Mr. Karos said he has been buying stocks in some sectors that could briefly take a hit from icy weather, such as trucking companies, airlines, and auto parts.
Further muddying the picture was the leadership of sectors that are often seen as defensive plays. The telecommunications, health-care and utilities sectors were among the top gainers in the S&P 500. The telecom gains were led by Dow component

which rose after Jefferies analysts said "investors should take advantage of recent weakness" in the stock.
"We're not getting a clear message from this day of trading," said 



      David Lefkowitz, 



       equity strategist with UBS Wealth Management. "These are not the sectors you go to when you're feeling psyched about U.S. growth."
Still, he said, UBS remains positive on U.S. stocks for the year.
"Bigger picture, I don't think anything has really changed," he said. "People are comfortable that the recovery in the U.S. is still on track."
Traders said that a broad range of investors were buying shares on Thursday. 



      Dave Lutz, 



       head of exchange-traded fund trading at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said investors were shuffling positions to take on more risk during the session.
Since the start of the year, "there has been a tremendous amount of protection bought" against stock-market declines, he said. "Given how crowded that's been, you've got some people reversing [their] hedges."
In economic news, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its February index of manufacturing activity was negative for the first time in nine months, but attributed much of the weakness to severe winter weather. The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for January rose 0.3%, while a 0.4% jump was projected.
Markit reported that U.S. manufacturing activity showed the strongest monthly improvement since May 2010, while jobless claims in the latest week and the consumer-price index, a measure of inflation, were nearly in line with forecasts.
Asian stock markets dropped after data showed Chinese manufacturing activity contracted further in February, and European markets pared early losses to trade mixed after a report indicating economic activity slowed in the euro zone.
The Stoxx Europe 600 recovered from early losses to close less than 0.1% lower, just its second decline in 12 sessions. Germany's DAX 30 index dropped 0.4%, France's CAC 40 gained 0.3% and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 added 0.2%.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average slumped 2.1% as the weak Chinese data strengthened the yen, which weighed on exporter shares. China's Shanghai Composite slipped 0.2%.
Gold futures declined 0.3% to $1,317.10 a troy ounce, after snapping a nine-session win streak on Wednesday. Crude-oil futures fell 0.4% to $102.92 a barrel after settling at a four-and-a-half-month high on Wednesday. The dollar edged higher against the euro and the yen.
In corporate news,
rose to close the session at a new all-time high. The company said late Wednesday it agreed to buy messaging company WhatsApp for $19 billion in cash and stock.

declined after Barclays analysts downgraded the stock, saying they "believe it is time to step aside." They don't expect the company's new products to "move the needle" for sales, "given a maturing smartphone market," and said it could face margin pressures as well.
Shares of
surged after the electric-car maker reported late Wednesday fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates and provided an upbeat 2014 outlook.
Dow component
declined after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings at the low end of its previously lowered forecast range. The world's largest retailer also provided a current-quarter outlook below analyst estimates.

rose after saying late Wednesday it was in discussions about a possible sale of the company. The grocer also said it would distribute the remaining 37.8 million shares its owns—a 72.2% stake—in Blackhawk Network Holdings to Safeway's shareholders.
